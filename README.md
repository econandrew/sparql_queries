# Miscellaneous useful SPARQL queries & resulting datasets

There is a tremendous amount of useful structured data in places like Wikidata and DBPedia (and formerly, Freebase). The lingua franca of querying this structured semantic data is SPARQL, but unfortunately is has a slightly weird syntax, and I don't use it often enough to remember it well. So this is a repository of useful datasets I have extracted to a more useable form, at some point. Hopefully this will be useful to others too, either the data directly or the queries as examples.

- [country_aliases](country_aliases) - a big list of different names for countries, extracted from Wikidata
